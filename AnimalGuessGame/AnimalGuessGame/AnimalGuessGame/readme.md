What did you learn?
I mostly learned how to apply our data structures to a practical application. Also apparently Machine learning?

Where did you look?
I didn't do any research, we just dove right in. It seemed pretty straightforward.

What notes did you use to help you successfully complete the challenge?
I mostly thought about and used the previous data structure assignments. I used the array initializer and a variation of the add and delete methods.
