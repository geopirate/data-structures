What did you learn? 
Explain how you felt before starting the challenge, what did you learn while researching, and how well do you understand the data structure after your self research

I felt initially that this would be more challenging than the other BST operations we've done so far, but no so hard that I couldn't figure it out.  I learned about various things that do and won't work for deletion, by trial and error and debate.  I understand it much better after completing the challenge.

Where did you look? 

Brandon looked at a few articles from last night to tonight.  I didn't do any external research and just thought about the problem and bounced ideas off my partner.

Be specific, what sites? resources? Books?

See previous.

What notes did you use to help you successfully complete the challenge? 

We just used the whiteboard to take notes, pictures are included in the repo.

Did you write anything down, bookmark anything that looked useful?

I only wrote down things on the whiteboard and in the code editor as we were prototyping and hacking away at the problem.

What did you use as a guideline or direction during the challenge?)

I bounced ideas off my partner and the success and failure of trying out different combinations of code.  I also put in various console.writelines in the code to check code executiuon.
