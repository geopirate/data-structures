What did you learn? 
Explain how you felt before starting the challenge, what did you learn while researching, and how well do you understand the data structure after your self research

I felt initially that this wouldn't be too challenging.  
My initial thought before writing any code was recursive calls to get half of the array and split it.  
This ended up being more complicated than our actual solution, even though it was in the right direction.
We had a snag with using Math.Floor and casting to an int, but it just took a few minutes to work around it.
I understand it much better after completing the challenge.

Where did you look? 

We mostly just thought about the problem and bounced ideas off each other.
Brandon looked at an article for inspriration after we brainstorming for a few minues on the whiteboard.  

Be specific, what sites? resources? Books?

Brandon looked at http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorted-array-to-balanced-bst/

What notes did you use to help you successfully complete the challenge? 

We just used the whiteboard to take notes, pictures are included in the repo.

Did you write anything down, bookmark anything that looked useful?

I only wrote down things on the whiteboard and in the code editor as we were prototyping and hacking away at the problem.

What did you use as a guideline or direction during the challenge?)

I bounced ideas off my partner and the success and failure of trying out different combinations of code.  
I also put in various console.writelines in the code to check code executiuon.
