### What did you learn?
I was eintroduced to the Fibonacci sequence puzzle and how to manage it with recursion.
### Explain how you felt before starting the challenge, what did you learn while researching, and how well do you understand the data structure after your self research
I felt this would be a pretty easy data structure to implement.  We came up with the solution fairly quickly on the whiteboard.  We did run into an issue with the decrementing recursion reversing the numbers before returning a result and patched that problem with a workaround.
### Where did you look?
We just saw the material that was presented in class, we tried to figure it out and didn't do further research.
#### Be specific, what sites? resources? Books?
See previous answer.
### What notes did you use to help you successfully complete the challenge?
We just took notes on the whiteboard.
#### Did you write anything down, bookmark anything that looked useful?
No, see previous answeers.
#### What did you use as a guideline or direction during the challenge?)
We mostly used each other as references as we worked through the problem and iteratively tried to craft a solution.
