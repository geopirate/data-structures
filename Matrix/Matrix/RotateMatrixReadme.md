What did you learn?
I learned how to implement matrix rotation.
Explain how you felt before starting the challenge, what did you learn while researching, and how well do you understand the data structure after your self research
I felt this would be a challenging but pretty straightforward data structure to implement as I remember reading about this problem years ago, but not how to implement it exactly.  I understand it pretty well and we didn't do any research and we just figured it out on the whiteboard.
Where did you look?
I did not do any research, I saw a youtube video from the writer of cracking the coding interview about 2 years ago.
Be specific, what sites? resources? Books?
See previous answer.
What notes did you use to help you successfully complete the challenge?
We just took notes on the whiteboard.
Did you write anything down, bookmark anything that looked useful?
No, see previous answeers.
What did you use as a guideline or direction during the challenge?)
We mostly used each other as references as we worked through the problem and iteratively crafted a solution.
The whiteboard solution we came up with rotates the outside and I just had to implement additional rounds of rotation in code.
