What did you learn?
I learned a new way to implement an insertion sort.
Explain how you felt before starting the challenge, what did you learn while researching, and how well do you understand the data structure after your self research
I felt this would be a pretty straightforward data structure to implement.  I understand it pretty well because we didn't really rely on much research and we just figured it out on the whiteboard.
Where did you look?
I just read the first couple paragraphs of the reference material provided, to figure out what we are supposed to do but I didn't look at the code.
Be specific, what sites? resources? Books?
See previous answer.
What notes did you use to help you successfully complete the challenge?
We just took notes on the whiteboard.
Did you write anything down, bookmark anything that looked useful?
No, see previous answeers.
What did you use as a guideline or direction during the challenge?)
We mostly used each other as references as we worked through the problem and iteratively crafted a solution.
