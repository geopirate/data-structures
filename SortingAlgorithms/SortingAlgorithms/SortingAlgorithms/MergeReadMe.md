What did you learn?
I figured out at least conceptually how a quick sort works.
Explain how you felt before starting the challenge, what did you learn while researching, and how well do you understand the data structure after your self research
I felt this would be a pretty challenging data structure to implement.  I understand it betrter than when I started, but not completely as we did not come up with a final solution.
Where did you look?
I just read through the reference material provided, to figure out what we are supposed to do, and still didn't quite understand.
Be specific, what sites? resources? Books?
See previous answer.
What notes did you use to help you successfully complete the challenge?
We just took notes on the whiteboard.
Did you write anything down, bookmark anything that looked useful?
No, see previous answeers.
What did you use as a guideline or direction during the challenge?)
We mostly used each other as references as we worked through the problem and iteratively tried to craft a solution.  We also worked with the TAs especially Nathan.
