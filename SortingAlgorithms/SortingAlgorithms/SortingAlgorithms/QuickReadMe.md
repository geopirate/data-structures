What did you learn?
I learned a lot about more advanced recursion to finally get this to work.
We initally ran out of time and just had the whiteboard concepts and a little code.
I came back and finished hacking out the code at home as I figured out how it works.
Explain how you felt before starting the challenge, what did you learn while researching, and how well do you understand the data structure after your self research
I felt this would be a pretty challenging data structure to implement.
I 
Where did you look?
I just read a good chunk of the of the reference material provided, to figure out what we are supposed to do before even starting on the white board.
I worked through the challenge time before spending a few minutes writing code at school.  Our time was cut short due to another meeting.
I hacked out the code on my own at home, but I didn't need to do research outside of the wiki provided.
Be specific, what sites? resources? Books?
See previous response, just the Wiki.
What notes did you use to help you successfully complete the challenge?
We just took notes on the whiteboard.  There was quite a bit of erasing and starting over though.
Did you write anything down, bookmark anything that looked useful?
No, see previous answeers.
What did you use as a guideline or direction during the challenge?)
We mostly used each other as references as we worked through the problem and iteratively tried to craft a solution.  
I ended up just hammering out a lot of the code as our whitboarding didn't really get into the details much.
