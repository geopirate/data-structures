What did you learn?
I learned a ton about how the Radix sort works, but I don't think I could implement it without Queues.
We had a good conceptual plan, but it required some serious refactoring in code.
Explain how you felt before starting the challenge, what did you learn while researching, and how well do you understand the data structure after your self research
I felt this would be a pretty challenging data structure to implement.
I didn't understand it at all when I started, and I couldn't make sense of it until I got to the part in the reading about implementing with queues.   
I understand it pretty well through the scope of a series of queues.
Where did you look?
I just read a good chunk of the of the reference material provided, to figure out what we are supposed to do before even starting on the white board.
I worked through the challenge time before spending a few minutes writing code at school.  I got a hint from Nathan that mod was needed.
I then did some more research as I ran into various issues.
Be specific, what sites? resources? Books?
	I figured out how to use modulus effectively for this from adapting a stack overflow solution for a similar problem. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13752726/get-the-seventh-digit-from-an-integer
	I figured out how to make my array of Queues work after hitting a null reference error. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26692661/insert-item-to-an-array-of-queue-c-sharp
What notes did you use to help you successfully complete the challenge?
We just took notes on the whiteboard.  There was quite a bit of erasing and starting over though.
Did you write anything down, bookmark anything that looked useful?
No, see previous answeers.
What did you use as a guideline or direction during the challenge?)
We mostly used each other as references as we worked through the problem and iteratively tried to craft a solution.  
My partner had a good look at the example in the reference, but we mostly ignored that while we worked on the problem.
I ended up just hammering out a lot of the code as our whitboarding didn't really get into the details much.
