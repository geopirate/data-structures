### What did you learn?
I was exposed to the tower of hanoi problem and started to wrap my head around it.
### Explain how you felt before starting the challenge, what did you learn while researching, and how well do you understand the data structure after your self research
I felt this would be a pretty challenging data structure to implement.  I understand it betrter than when I started, but not completely as we did not come up with a final solution.
### Where did you look?
We just saw the material that was presented in class, we tried to figure it out and didn't do further research.
#### Be specific, what sites? resources? Books?
See previous answer.
### What notes did you use to help you successfully complete the challenge?
We just took notes on the whiteboard.
#### Did you write anything down, bookmark anything that looked useful?
No, see previous answeers.
#### What did you use as a guideline or direction during the challenge?)
We mostly used each other as references as we worked through the problem and iteratively tried to craft a solution.
