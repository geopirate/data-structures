<h1>Reverse Strings</h1>

<p>This is a pretty simple console application that accepts a string and returns the string reversed.  I just used a second string in my preferred implementation to read in the values in reverse.</p>
<p> I also included and commented out an alternative implementation using a char array which could be even further optimized with the Array.Reverse() method, but it would not show that I understand how this works.</p>
